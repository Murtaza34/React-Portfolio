# React Portfolio with Material UI

Welcome to my [React](https://react.dev/) Portfolio project! For this project, I decided to use [Material UI](https://mui.com/) to help me create a clean and modern design. With Material UI's pre-built components and styling options, I was able to focus on the functionality of my portfolio while also making it look great. This project showcases my skills and projects, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it.
